# Visual Recognition Course @ MIMUW

This repository contains my own solutions to the "Visual Recognition" course at [MIMUW](https://www.mimuw.edu.pl/). The course focuses on deep learning architectures, implementation techniques, training, and debugging of neural networks for image recognition. Through this course, I have gained theoretical knowledge, insights into contemporary research in the field, and practical skills related to image recognition.

## Course Description

The course covers the following topics:

1. Introduction to Image Recognition (Classical methods: SIFT, Hough Transform)
2. Convolutional Neural Networks - Review
3. Visualization and Interpretability
4. Object Detection
5. Semantic Segmentation and Instance Segmentation
6. Video Understanding
7. 3D Vision
8. Generative Models

For more details, please refer to the [course website](https://www.mimuw.edu.pl/~bilinski/VRNN2023/).

## Learning Outcomes
This course aims to educate students on cutting-edge deep learning architectures for visual recognition, as well as instruct them on implementing, training, and troubleshooting neural networks. It encompasses theoretical knowledge, the latest research findings, and practical skills development.
